# Run and deploy your AI Studio app

This contains everything you need to run your app locally.

View your app in AI Studio: https://ai.studio/apps/328f1f1f-1bc9-4087-b227-2d41af8a6280

## Run Locally

**Prerequisites:**  Node.js


1. Install dependencies:
   `npm install`
2. Copy [.env.example](.env.example) to `.env.local`
3. Optional: set the `VITE_FIREBASE_*` values in `.env.local` to enable multi-screen sync
4. Optional: set `GEMINI_API_KEY` if you are running this through AI Studio
5. Run the app:
   `npm run dev`

Without Firebase values, the app still runs locally as a single-screen preview and shows sync as disabled.
